# Dissertation Experiments

Performance and correctness testing for my 5th year dissertation. See [Conjure Oxide](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-oxide)

## Installation

Install [Conjure Oxide](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-oxide) as an executable. Instructions to install from source can be found in the project's README.

This project uses [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) to test several problem instances efficiently in high-performance computing environments.

Install [jq](https://jqlang.org/) for command-line JSON parsing.

### Python Environment

Create a python environment in the project directory (3.11+) and run:

```
    .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
